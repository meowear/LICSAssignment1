Changed a few things in task 6 in the main.cpp file but not in task.cpp.Didnt update the task 6 file(printing the cnf formula) ......too lazy to import since i made use of task 2 function
Changed the get truth value functions of task 5 only in main.cpp not in task5.cpp since if no of atoms>20 taking long(40 sec+) to produce truth table more than a million entries.Put up a restriction only prints truth table if no of atoms are less than 20.
Made a few naming changes in main.cpp and not the original task files.
Please delete my comments and add proper comments since they are too casual and mostly useless
-----------------------restrictions for documentation----------------------------------------------------
the string type input can hold only 26 alphabet + 10 char (0 to 9) so 36 in total
fails if encounters different symbols in cnf case ...didnt properly define fall backs
n<=20 for printing truth table else too long
task 6 can also be too long depending on the formula didnt define any explicit condition will probably get some runtime exception or smtg
//these are the ones i remember of the back of my head u should  check for more
